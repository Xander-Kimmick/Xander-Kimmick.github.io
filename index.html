                            Customers are struggling to find affordable hardware and software for their video gaming needs online. With hundreds of different retailers, it can be impossible to find the best possible deal with the least possible effort.

                        <p>
                            My group collaborated in order to get a better idea of what features were imporant to us, who our target audience was, what we wanted our GUI to look like, and problems we may run into throughout the project.

                        My group members each made a personna in order to get a better idea of who potential customers could be.

                <p>
                    My group members and I each created a story board following someone in a situation where we would need to use our app to get a better idea of potential users.

                        <p>
                            Each member of my group sketched a design of how they believe our app should work. This helped us better flesh out our design and give visual examples of how our app could work.

                            <p>
                                Used paper to flesh out our ideas for all screens in our app. Each group member completed their own variation and we then came together to talk about what we liked and disliked about the app.
